# RadioStreamDeck
* My try to use / adapt the Stream Deck for the daily needs of a radiologist.
* This has to work on a Windows 10 64 bit machine without root access.

## Used/Useful packages
* The basis for this is - of course - the [Python Elgato Stream Deck Library][pesdl]
  * Which nees an image manipulation library, usually [the PIL fork pillow][gpil]
* For more functionality I will probably be using [pyperclip][gpyper] and [pyautogui][gpyaut]
